First, do the project in Rust
Then in Python to check speed difference

Image segmentation : 2 types 
	- Pixels on the border of segments are green
	- Image is all white except pixels on border segements which are green
	
Algorithms : 2 types
	- Weighted-sum (?) Simple GA
	- MOEA (NSGA-11 or SPEA)
	
Choose a color space (RGB or CIA)

For all algos :
Choose a representation (choose or make new, usually graph or tree-based)
3 objectives to optimize, described p.4 (use Pareto-optimality in MOEA, and blend them with empicically chosen proportions in simple GA)
Evaluation criterion : PRI (p.5-6). Allows to choose the best Pareto-optimal solution in MOEA, and judge the effectiveness of a solution

For image processing : image crate

Genome representation : an array same size as the image, with values 0 to 4, 0 is neutral, and 1 2 3 4 are links to the top right bottom left respectively


Questions :
PRI is not fitness function ?
Does color space influence results ?
Can I see an implementation of previous GA ?

Things to try later :
SPEA instead of NSGA-11
Use the PRI as my fitness function for simple GA
