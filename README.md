# Evolutionary Image Segmentation
Project for IT-3708 - Bio-Inspired Artificial Intelligence

It implements a simple genetic algorithm and a more complex multi-objective evolutionary algorithm to solve an image segmentation problem.

The code was designed purely for submission so it is very light on comments.
